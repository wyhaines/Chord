Chord
===========

Swiftcore::Chord

This is an implementation of the Chord protocol, a description of which
can be found here:

The implementation is based on the psuedocode and implementation suggestions
in the MIT papers, but it has some modifications.

As it stands currently, nodes can balance their workload with their
successor. It currently does this by comparing its workload to the load
of the successor. If the successor has a sufficiently larger load, as
determined by the Swiftcore::Chord::Node#calculate_allowable_difference
method, then the node will advance its ID, and thus, the keyspace that it
is responsible for, towards that of its successor. It then tells its
successor to reallocate data that lies in the new keyspace to it.

By only moving towards a successor, without ever changing relative
positions, changing a node's id/keyspace coverage doesn't harm the ability
of the the chord to find the data in any given node, and the balancing
algorithm will eventually result in well distributed nodes, even as data
changes and nodes are added or removed from the chord.
