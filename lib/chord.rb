# hord
#
# This is an implementation of the Chord protocol, descriptions of which
# can be found here:
#   http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/chord/papers/chord.pdf
#   http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/chord/papers/paper-ton.pdf
#   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28peer-to-peer%29
#
# The implementation is based closely on the pseudocode found in those
# papers, with some modifications for both functionality and resiliency.
#
# As it stands currently, nodes can balance their workload with their
# successor. It currently does this by comparing its workload to the load
# of the successor. If the successor has a sufficiently larger load, as
# determined by the Chord::Node#calculate_allowable_difference
# method, then the node will advance its ID, and thus, the keyspace that it
# is responsible for, towards that of its successor. It then tells its
# successor to reallocate data that lies in the new keyspace to it.
#
# By only moving towards a successor, without ever changing relative
# positions, changing a node's id/keyspace coverage doesn't harm the ability
# of the the chord to find the data in any given node, and the balancing
# algorithm will eventually result in well distributed nodes, even as data
# changes and nodes are added or removed from the chord.
