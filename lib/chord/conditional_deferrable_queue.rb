  # ConditionalDeferrable objects are placed into this queue. Periodically
  # the queue will be executed, and each deferrable object will have its
  # conditions evaluated. If the conditions all succeed, then the callback(s)
  # on it will execute. Those callbacks are able to queue additional future
  # work. If any of the conditions fail, then the errback(s) on the object
  # are called. If the deferrable state is unknown, it will be requeued for
  # evaluation at a later date.
  # TODO: Make this queue a two layer queue. Items which are repeatedly
  # TODO: requeued fall into the second layer, and are evaluated less often.
  # TODO: This would let slow stuff consume fewer resources during their
  # TODO: condition checks.
